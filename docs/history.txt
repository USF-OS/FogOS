HISTORY command README

History saves your previous command line commands in a circular 
queue using the queue.c file we made. Through typing history in 
the command line you should see a list outprinted to your 
terminal in order from your most recent commands on the bottom
and your least at the top. 

Currently we have size defined as 10 at the beginning of the 
queue.c file. This is for testing purposes.
