The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A watched pot never boils.
All's well that ends well.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Actions speak louder than words.
The early bird catches the worm.
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
